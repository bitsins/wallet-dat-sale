### HOW TO DECRYPT? ###

To decrypt the wallets, you need to find their passwords. To do this, i reccomend using hashcat.net which is the fastest password cracker right now. If you have a strong GPU, with some time you should be able to crack them. You can use the hints in the repo files to make the cracking process faster.

For more information, check the tutorials about password cracking on hashcat.net.
